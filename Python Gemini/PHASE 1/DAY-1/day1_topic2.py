Imagine a scenario where a user buys two products.

Create a new variable, quantity, and set its value to 2 (as an integer).

Write a single Python expression to calculate the total_cost by multiplying the price variable you already created by the new quantity variable.

Print the result of total_cost.

quantity = 2
price = 99.99 # This is the variable told to be taken from the previous code snippet
